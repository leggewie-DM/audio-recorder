Description: Audio recorder for GNOME and Unity Desktops
 This program allows you to record your favourite music or audio to a file. 
 It can record audio from your system soundcard, microphones, browsers and 
 webcams. Put simply; if it plays out of your loudspeakers you can record it. 
 This program has a timer that can start, stop or pause recording on certain 
 conditions such as audio level, file size and clock time. This recorder can 
 automatically record your Skype calls. It supports several audio (output) 
 formats such as OGG audio, Flac, MP3 and WAV.
