<h3>Default filename</h3>

<p>The default filename has format <b>%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S</b>. <br>
It uses date and time to create a unique filename for each recording.<br>
</p>

<p>The resulting filename from the default pattern looks like <b>2012-12-31-09:39:17.ogg</b>. As you can see, the symbols have been replaced with current date (31.12.2012) and time (09:39:17 am)</b>. This format will keep the files sorted by date-time.
</p>

<p>The file extension (such as .ogg, .mp3 or .m4a) is automatically set to what you have 
selected in the main window. You simply select the audio format (and file extension) in the GUI.
</p>

<p>
The recordings are by default saved into your Audio folder. You can change this location in the settings.
</p>
